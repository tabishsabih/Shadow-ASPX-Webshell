$had0w ASPX Webshell

I have written an aspx webshell for my VAPT engagements. During the engagement, I often used to face where the AV or Endpoint Solution would block a webshell because it is too popular. Therefore I created my own, also adding the functionality that I would want out of a webshell.
Upload the webshell on the target webserver, and call it via the browser. Pwn away!
